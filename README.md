## About

This serves as the front-end of a simple web application that can allow a user to login and manipulate a visual representation of a user database table. These actions include: adding, editing and deleting a user.

[Here is the back-end part](https://github.com/SneakyShrike/login-api) of the web app that compliments this.

The purpose of this project is to gain an insight into the Javascript ReactJS framework and front-end web app development in general. It will also serve as a foundation for similar projects I might pursue in the future.
